## Code for "Exploiting hierarchical taxonomy for prompt-based Continual Learning"

### Reproduce the reported results with the scripts in `training_scripts/`

#### Note:
  - If you want to try with other order of tasks/classes, you need to modify the content in the folder `taxanomy/` accordingly.
  - For more convenient when examining our main idea, the existing values of params is set for the version when using our hierarchical taxonomy strategy, without any trick (OT-trick (4.2.2) and eval-trick (4.3))

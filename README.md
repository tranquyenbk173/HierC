## Code for "Exploiting hierarchical taxonomy for prompt-based Continual Learning"

### Reproduce the reported results with the scripts in `training_scripts/`

#### Note:
  - If you want to try with orders of tasks/classes, you need to modify the content in the folder `taxanomy/` accordingly.
  - For more convenience when examining our main idea, the existing values of params are set for the version when using our hierarchical taxonomy strategy, without any trick (OT-trick (4.2.2) and eval-trick (4.3)). For the full version of our method, please change the corresponding params.
